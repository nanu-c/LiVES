As user root copy the files LiVES-0.9.5-1.spec and build-lives to your
rpm SPECS directory. The files LiVES_logo_??.png and LiVES.desktop
should be copied to your rpm SOURCE directory.
For native redhat installations such directories are in
/usr/src/redhat, Mandriva has them in /usr/src/mandrake, others installations might
have them elsewhere under /usr/src or /usr/local/src.
