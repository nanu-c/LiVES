Weed Audio Extension 1.1 final version.


(C) Gabriel "Salsaman" Finch 2005 - 2008

Version 1.1 - added "is_volume_master" to assist with host automation
of audio



The Weed Audio Extension adds audio capabilities to the standard
WEED_PLANT_CHANNEL_TEMPLATE and WEED_PLANT_CHANNEL.



== WEED_PLANT_CHANNEL_TEMPLATE ==

For audio channels, the "palette_list" leaf should be
ommited. The host should not set a "current_palette" or pass video
data in such a channel.

For example, this can be used to process a backing audio track.



For channels which support audio, the following leaf must be defined
in the template:

Mandatory leaves:

"is_audio" : WEED_SEED_BOOLEAN : if set to WEED_TRUE, then this
channel is audio.


Optional leaves:
the plugin may define these to force them for the host, or it may
leave them undefined.

"audio_data_length" : WEED_SEED_INT : maximum length of audio_data in
samples

"audio_interleaf" : WEED_SEED_BOOLEAN : if WEED_TRUE, then audio
channels should be interleaved

"audio_channels" : WEED_SEED_INT : number of audio channels in the
audio_data : must be >=1 (mono), 2==stereo, etc.

"audio_rate" : WEED_SEED_INT : the audio sample rate in Hz. 






== WEED_PLANT_CHANNEL ==



Mandatory leaves for CHANNELS with audio:

"audio_data" : WEED_SEED_VOIDPTR : stores a pointer to 32 bit signed float data for
	       audio buffer. Values within the buffer are in the range -1.0 <=
	       value <= 1.0. [can be NULL if the host has no audio to pass].

"audio_data_length" : WEED_SEED_INT : length of audio_data in samples
                                      [can be 0 if the host has no audio to pass]

"audio_interleaf" : WEED_SEED_BOOLEAN : if WEED_TRUE, then audio
channels are interleaved

"audio_channels" : WEED_SEED_INT : number of audio channels in the
audio_data : must be >=1 (mono), 2==stereo, etc.

"audio_rate" : WEED_SEED_INT : the audio sample rate in Hz. 




Notes:

In the case that the host has no audio at all for a channel, it can
set "audio_data" to NULL, and leave all other audio leaves
undefined.

If the host sets the values "audio_channels", "audio_rate", or
"audio_interleaf" itself, then the values for all channels MUST be
set the same.

"audio_channels", "audio_rate", and "audio_interleaf" MUST not be
changed without a re-init of the plugin.







== WEED_PLANT_PARAMETER_TEMPLATE ==

"is_volume_master" : WEED_SEED_BOOLEAN : for volume-only effects, there are a couple of things
that must be done. First the filter template flag bit
WEED_FILTER_IS_CONVERTER must be set. Second, exactly one of the
parameter templates must be marked by setting the leaf "is_volume_master" to WEED_TRUE.
This is to allow host automation.

Such a parameter must be a float, and must *linearly* adjust the volume for all audio
sub-channels (in the sense of "left" and "right" sub-channels) between 0.0 (no volume) and 1.0 (no amplification). The
maximum may optionally go beyond 1.0 (for an amplifier/pre-amp). It
could also be thought of as the "gain" control.

This flag can be combined with the flag WEED_PARAMETER_ELEMENT_PER_CHANNEL
in the case of repeating Weed audio channels (see "max_repeats" in the channel
template description of the main Weed spec). This would create some
kind of audio mixer in the host.


Summary

== HOST_INFO leaves ==

"host_audio_player" : WEED_SEED_STRING : name of the host audio
player. Examples are "jack", "sox", "mplayer".
