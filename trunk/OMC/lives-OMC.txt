/video/play
/clip/select 2
/effect_key/enable 8

-------------------------

OSC in LiVES. 

LiVES now implements a standard version of Open Sound Control (http://www.opensoundcontrol.org)
which is being extended to OMC (Open Media Control) by members of Piksel.

LiVES currently supports libOSC and sendOSC from here:

http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/index.html

LiVES is now compiled with OSC support by default. There are several
ways to activate it:

start up LiVES with, e.g.: lives -oscstart 49999

this will start up LiVES with OSC enabled on port 49999.

Or, start up LiVES normally and go to Tools/Preferences/Streaming. Here
you can ask LiVES to open a UDP port (default 49999, this can be changed). You can also ask LiVES to open an 
OSC port every time it starts up (doing this can be a security risk, please check your firewall settings 
first !)

You can then send commands using sendOSC. The autolives.pl script shows a sample implementation of it.
If using the default port (49999) you can just type: autolives.pl, for other ports, use 
autolives.pl localhost <port> where <port> is the UDP port number in Preferences.
You can also run autolives.pl from another host using autolives.pl <host> <port>

Note that there is a default latency of up to 40ms for OSC commands to be processed in LiVES.
Depending on what the application is doing, commands could be processed slower than that.



INCOMING MESSAGES
-----------------
This is actually implemented now using the keyboard timer, so there is a default maximum latency of 4 ms.

Timecodes are ignored.

Floats are supported, but be aware that pd (pure data) will
sometimes send a float as an int (for example (float)1.0 is sent as (int)1).
