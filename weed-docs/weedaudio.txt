Weed Audio Extension 1.1 final version.


(C) Gabriel "Salsaman" Finch 2005 - 2008

Version 1.1 - added "is_volume_master" to assist with host automation
of audio

22 Nov 2011 - clarified what kinds of channel patterns expected




The Weed Audio Extension adds audio capabilities to the standard
WEED_PLANT_CHANNEL_TEMPLATE and WEED_PLANT_CHANNEL.




Generally, the following rules should apply:
- audio and video channels should not be mixed in a single filter: - the only time this should be done is 
  for generators which are sources of both video and audio

- generating video from audio or vice versa is best done by using two plugins - one to analyse the input and produce 
  output parameters, the second to convert the parameters into audio or video data

- plugins which deal with audio MUST be able to process small chunks of audio extremely fast 
  (sub millisecond processing time - they may be called much more frequently than video effects, which is why mixing 
  audio and video channels is not recommended); alternately the host may buffer one video frames-worth of audio and 
  send this to the plugin

  [except for audio generators which may generate audio more slowly - generally they will be called at the video frame rate 
   and asked to return a frames-worth of audio each time









== WEED_PLANT_CHANNEL_TEMPLATE ==

For audio channels, the "palette_list" leaf should be
omitted. The host should not set a "current_palette" or pass video
data in such a channel.

For example, this can be used to process a backing audio track.



For channels which support audio, the following leaf must be defined
in the template:

Mandatory leaves:

"is_audio" : WEED_SEED_BOOLEAN : if set to WEED_TRUE, then this
channel is audio.


Optional leaves:
the plugin may define these to try to force them for the host, or it may
leave them undefined. It is highly recommended that the plugin leave these values undefined.

"audio_data_length" : WEED_SEED_INT : maximum length of audio_data in
samples

"audio_interleaf" : WEED_SEED_BOOLEAN : if WEED_TRUE, then audio
channels should be interleaved

"audio_channels" : WEED_SEED_INT : number of audio channels in the
audio_data : must be >=1 (mono), 2==stereo, etc.

"audio_rate" : WEED_SEED_INT : the audio sample rate in Hz. 






== WEED_PLANT_CHANNEL ==



Mandatory leaves for CHANNELS with audio - these values are set by the host:

"audio_data" : WEED_SEED_VOIDPTR : stores a pointer to 32 bit signed float data for
	       audio buffer. Values within the buffer are in the range -1.0 <=
	       value <= 1.0. [can be NULL if the host has no audio to pass].

"audio_data_length" : WEED_SEED_INT : length of audio_data in samples
                                      [can be 0 if the host has no audio to pass]

"audio_interleaf" : WEED_SEED_BOOLEAN : if WEED_TRUE, then audio
channels are interleaved

"audio_channels" : WEED_SEED_INT : number of audio channels in the
audio_data : must be >=1 (mono), 2==stereo, etc.

"audio_rate" : WEED_SEED_INT : the audio sample rate in Hz. 




Notes:

In the case that the host has no audio at all for a channel, it can
set "audio_data" to NULL, and leave all other audio leaves
undefined.

If the host sets the values "audio_channels", "audio_rate", or
"audio_interleaf" itself, then the values for all channels MUST be
set the same.

"audio_channels", "audio_rate", and "audio_interleaf" MUST not be
changed without a re-init of the plugin.







== WEED_PLANT_PARAMETER_TEMPLATE ==

"is_volume_master" : WEED_SEED_BOOLEAN : for volume-only effects, there are a couple of things
that must be done. First the filter template flag bit
WEED_FILTER_IS_CONVERTER must be set. Second, exactly one of the
parameter templates must be marked by setting the leaf "is_volume_master" to WEED_TRUE.
This is to allow host automation.

Such a parameter must be a float, and must *linearly* adjust the volume for all audio
sub-channels (in the sense of "left" and "right" sub-channels) between 0.0 (no volume) and 1.0 (no amplification). The
maximum may optionally go beyond 1.0 (for an amplifier/pre-amp). It
could also be thought of as the "gain" control.

This flag can be combined with the flag WEED_PARAMETER_ELEMENT_PER_CHANNEL
in the case of repeating Weed audio channels (see "max_repeats" in the channel
template description of the main Weed spec). This would create some
kind of audio mixer in the host.


Summary

== HOST_INFO leaves ==

"host_audio_player" : WEED_SEED_STRING : name of the host audio
player. Examples are "jack", "sox", "mplayer".
